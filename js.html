				_/*
					So you've decided to take the plunge and learn the most-used language out there today. A language used in browsers and servers, desktop PCs and mobile games. Welcome to JavaScript.
					The best way to get started learning a language is to start writing it. If you're on a mobile device and have a PC or laptop handy, I'd recommend switching to that while you're working through this document; it'll allow you to try things out as we go. If not, feel free to look back at this page at a later time and try some of the examples yourself.
					Once you've opened your browser and opened this page, hit the "F12" key. This should open up the browser's "developer tools". If it doesn't try right-clicking in the page and selecting the "inspect element" option, or similar. Then look for a "Console" tab, and activate it. Still having problems? Then I'd recommend you Google how to get to the "developer console" for your particular browser, and follow the instructions you find.
					(Some browsers allow you to change where the console appears, docking it to vertically to the right or along the bottom. If you prefer working a particular way, you can look into the settings and find a layout that works best for you.)
					The console is like a JavaScript playground. You can type any code in there, hit Enter, and the code will be run. Some code can change things on the page. Other code can add numbers together or produce other results, which will appear in the console window. As we go through the language and look at code examples, I'd recommend you try it out for yourself. Ideally, you'd type it in (most examples won't be too long for now, don't worry); but if you wish, you can copy the code text directly from the page and paste it in the console.
					You can also try changing parts of the code to see what effect it has. So after trying `1 + 1`, try `2 + 3` or `6 * 5`. Even when you try something that errors (gives a big, red, angry message telling you the code went wrong) don't worry. Unless you really know what you're doing, you shouldn't be able to break anything so that you can't keep playing and fiddling with the code.
					So now you've got the page open, and the console at the ready, it's time to start learning the basics of JavaScript.
					(Just a heads-up, when you see a double-forward-slash `//`, anything that comes after it on that line is a "comment". Also, a forward-slash immediately followed by an asterisk `/*` will start a multi-line comment, which will end at the next asterisk followed by a forward-slash `*_/`.)
					(Normally, any text in a script will be run as JavaScript code. But comments are ignored. They are often used to _comment_ on code, letting the reader know what it's doing, or describing the actions taken by the code itself. I'll be using comments to tell you things within the code examples. This should hopefully makes things a little easier to read.)
					Now you've been introduced, let's look at each primitive individually.
				*/,
			],
			[ "Basic Syntax",
				_/*
					In JavaScript, there are statements. Like that one. A statement is a self-contained piece of code that does something.
				*/,
				{ __proto__: Function, toString: function() {
					return _/*function() { // Statements
						a = 1		// This is a statement. It ends with a new line.
						b = 2		// This is another statement.
										// It will be run after the previous statement
										// has finished doing its thing.
						c = 3 d = 4	// Because there is no new line after the first statement,
										// all of the code is run together.
										// In this case, the code would break.
					}*/;
				} },
				_/*
					For this reason, always make sure you put a semicolon at the end of each statement. There are many coders that leave these out, but when you're starting out, adding these semicolons is a good habit to get into. Using these semicolons prevents the JavaScript engine from confusing what you meant or how things should all fit together.
				*/,
				function() { // Statements re-written using semicolons
					a = 1;
					b = 1;
					c = 3; d = 4;	// These semicolons allow you to have
										// multiple statements next to each other.
				},
				_/*
					Expressions are similar to statements, but they produce a value instead of doing something.
				*/,
				function() {
					1 + 1			// This is an expression.
										// This will give back, or "return", the result `2`.
					2 * 3 * 4		// This will return `24`.
					
					// Expressions can be grouped together to form more complex expressions.
					
					/* Let's look at this expression step-by-step: */ (1 + 1) * 3
					(1 + 1)		// Returns `2`. This value is then used as if
									// it would replace the bracketed expression.
									
					/* So the expression becomes: */ 2 * 3 // ...which returns `6`, as expected.
				},
				_/*
					(Note, in JavaScript (and most programming languages), multiplication us done using an asterisk `*`, and division by using a forward-slash `/`. If your keyboard has a number pad, you will see these along the top row.)
					You may notice that expressions work just like they do in mathematics. But this is also true for non-arithmetic operations, such as adding strings of text together, calling functions, and so on. Statements can have many expressions combining to produce a particular result, and expressions can have any number of expressions nested inside of them.
				*/,
				[ "Whitespace",
					_/*
						"Whitespace" refers to any characters that cannot normally be seen. For example, a space, or a tab, or even a new line character. In general, unless it's within an actual value (a string or a regular expression, which we'll cover later on), whitespace in your code is pretty much ignored.
					*/,
					function() {
						1 + 1;
						/* is the same as */ 1    +1;
						/* or */ 1 +
						1;
						
						/* or even */ 1
						+1;
					},
					_/*
						There are cases in which new lines _can_ have an effect on how the code is run, but generally, you can lay out your code whichever way seems best to you.
					*/
				]
			],
			[ "Values",
				_/*
					Values are what you work with in JavaScript to produce results. There are several _kinds_ of value we can use, called "types". For now, we'll focus on the primitive types. Don't worry; it's not as technical as it sounds. "Primitives" are just "_basic_ kinds of values". JavaScript has 6 primitives:
				*/,
				function() { // Primitives
					"abc"		// String
					123			// Number
					true		// Boolean (true or false)
					null		// represents "nothing", a non-value
					undefined	// represents a value that hasn't been set,
									// or "defined"
				},
				_/*
					(Just a heads-up, when you see a double-forward-slash, as above, anything that comes after it is a "comment". Normally, any text in a script will be run as JavaScript code. But comments are ignored. They are often used to _comment_ on code, letting the reader know what it's doing, or describing the actions taken by the code itself. I'll be using comments to tell you things within the code examples. This should hopefully makes things a little easier to read.)
					Now you've been introduced, let's look at each primitive individually.
				*/,
				[ "Strings",
					_/*
						A string starts with a quote (single or double), has any number of characters, and ends with another quote (matching the opening quote). So `"double quoted"` and `'single quoted'` are both strings.
						(Note that you cannot have new lines within a string. Doing so will break the script and throw an error (one of those angry red messages).)
						(Also, using the same quote character in a string as the one you started it with will end the string early, possibly breaking the script also. For example, the code `"text " more text"` will make the string `"text "`. Then `txt;more text"` will be treated as code, which would break the script. If you were to use the other kind of quote, however, you'll be just fine. For example, `" text ' more text"` will not end early, as there are no double-quotes used within the string.)
						Also, remember those "comments" we talked about? They don't work in the middle of strings. Virtually any character within a string is treated as just more text.
						The exception to this rule is "escaped characters". Using a back-slash `\` will "escape" the character following it, meaning it turns into another character. There are many ways of using escaped characters in strings, but I'll just go over the basics.
						While using a new line in the middle of a string will break it, you can add a new-line character by escaping the letter _n_, like so: `"\n"`. Similarly the letter _t_, when escaped, will produce a horizontal "tab" character, like so: `"\t"`.
						If the next character after the back-slash does _not_ start a special character, it will be made inert. So, when a quote is "escaped", it will _not_ end the string, even if the string is wrapped in that same kind of quote. For example, `"..."..."` will break as the string `txt;...`, whereas `"...\"..."` will produce a string containing `txt;..."...`, as expected. In the same way, you can escape the escape character itself, producing a regular back-slash. So while `"\n"` will produce a new-line character, `"\\n"` will leave the back-slash and letter _n_ intact, producing the string `txt;\n`.
					*/,
					[ "Concatenation",
						_/*
							Concatenation is just a fancy word for adding two strings together to make a new string. To do this, we use the `+` operator. For example, `"Hello" + " World"` produces the string `txt;Hello World`.
							(There's a fun little trick you can play with for concatenating strings. If you use the code `prompt("Type stuff in:")`, when the JavaScript engine gets to that code, it will stop everything and ask the user for input. So if you code something like `"Hello " + prompt("What is your name?")` and run it, the browser make a little popup, displaying the message `txt;What is your name?` (or whatever message you wrote in its place). Then, after the user (you) have typed in some text (such as `txt;Tom`) and clicked _Ok_, that string will be put in the place of the `prompt()` code, and added to the string. You can even have multiple prompts in the same string. Don't worry too much about how this works; I just wanted to give you something fun to play with.)

					Variables are a concept borrowed from mathematics, where they hold numbers and can be used in equations. For example, when the variable `x` is `5`, `x + 3` is `8`.
